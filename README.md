***Executive Summary:***

A growing e-commerce company is building a new warehouse, and the company would like all of the ***picking operations in the new warehouse to be performed by warehouse robots***. In the context of e-commerce warehousing, ***“picking” is the task of gathering individual items from various locations in the warehouse*** in order to fulfill customer orders. After picking items from the shelves, the robots must bring the items to a specific location within the warehouse where the items can be packaged for shipping. In order ***to ensure maximum efficiency and productivity, the robots will need to learn the shortest path*** between the box and all other locations within the warehouse where the robots are allowed to travel.
