***Executive Summary:***

In this notebook, a ***growing e-commerce company is building a new warehouse***, and the company would like ***all of the picking operations in the new warehouse to be performed by warehouse robots***. After picking items from the shelves, ***the robots must bring the items to a specific location within the warehouse*** where the items can be packaged for shipping. In order ***to ensure maximum efficiency and productivity, the robots will need to learn the shortest path*** between the item packaging area and all other locations within the warehouse where the robots are allowed to travel.
